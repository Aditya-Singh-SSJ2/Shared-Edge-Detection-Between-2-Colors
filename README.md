# Shared-Edge-Between-2-Colors-Using-OPENCV-PYTHON
This script prompts a user to enter 2 ranges of color using the trackbars,
and returns only the shared edges between the 2 colors if any in the input image.

# Libraries used:-
1. openCV2
2. numpy

# Example: 
The file input.png (attched along with the code) when passed through the code with user thresholding the blue and pink colour gives the output as output.png (attched along with the code).
