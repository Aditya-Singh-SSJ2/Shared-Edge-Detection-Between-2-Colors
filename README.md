# Shared-Edge-Between-2-Colors-Using-OPENCV-PYTHON
This script prompts the user to select two ranges of color using the trackbars,
and returns all the shared edges between the two colors if any in the input image.
I have chosen blue and pink as an example (see Input.png and Output.png) and have successfully detected all the shared edges between them.

# Libraries used:-
1. openCV2
2. numpy

# Example: 
The file input.png (attched along with the code) when passed through the code with user thresholding the blue and pink colour gives the output as output.png (attched along with the code).
